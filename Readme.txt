FE:
- Players: the game is multi-player, so at least 2 players are required for it

- Objectives: the main objective is to catch as many eggs as possible within the time given. 
After the time elapses, the egg hunt is won by the person who caught most eggs. Our game’s objective category is Race.

- Procedures: Each player is a bird inside a Computer like environment. 
The scene and players are entirely voxel based and hand made with the exception of the chicken and the bullets. 
After the game starts, all players enter where the scene the spawn points are set and start their egg search having limited time. 
Whenever a player finds a white egg and gets it, his score increases by 1. If he finds a golden egg, that is worth 2 points. 
If the player encounters another player and shots him, he freezes the opponent for 3 seconds. 
When the time elapses (after 2 minutes), the winner of the game is the one who has the highest score.
From the Menu Scene, the ‘Start Play’ button enables the player to start the game. 
The ‘Instructions’ button has all the controls of the game. The ‘Exit Game’ button let’s the player leave the game. 
After starting the game, the player can return to the menu by pressing the ‘M’ key.
The W-S-A-D keys are for the player’s movement (front-back-left-right) and the Space key is for jumping. 
You can jump at most 5 times once. The mouse is used for character rotation.

-Resources: time, bullets (to shot opponents)

-Conflict: other opponents

-Boundaries: the scene walls are the physical boundaries of the game

-Outcome: unequal outcome - Winner/Loser

It is definitely a multi-player game since the goal is to beat the other and get as many eggs as possible before your opponents.
Probably, the most unusual procedure that we used is the slowing down of opponents when the player shots them.
Our theme includes birds(chickens), which are the players. They have to find eggs. The environment is inside a Computer.
